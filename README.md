## Case Introduction
Cycling is a popular, accessible and effective mode of exercise in Singapore, but longer and more frequency usage has been held back due to the presence of key challenges and the need to manually find suitable routes and stops for longer journeys. CycleRoute is Web Application that automates and optimizes the route-finding process, and summarizes insights using insightful visualizations.

### Problem Description

With cycling gaining popularity recently, there has also been an increasing variety of consumer worries and needs. An individualâ€™s routine cycling journey currently has many rooms of improvements. These can generally be broken down based on time of occurrence, namely pre-riding, intra-riding and post-riding. The key challenges and concerns for either group have been described in Table 2.

##### Table 1: Key challenges & concerns of each cyclist segment.
| Group | Fitness & Cycling Enthusiasts |	Curious & Casual Cyclists |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-ride | Typically like to plan for longer, new and purposeful trips. Main challenge is the optimization* of routes they take, especially when embarking on new or longer ones. | Mainly cycle along routes that they are familiar with. Typically unaware of any appropriate medium to longer-length routes, especially beyond their immediate vicinity. |
| Intra-ride | Frequently makes stops along their journeys. Get bored of stopping at the same places or having to find new ones themselves. | Lack of familiarity with various routes also means lesser stops during cycling. |
| Post-ride | Interested to know key data such as distance, elevation, time, etc. to track for future comparison. | Typically do not track post-ride data because it is too tedious and time-consuming. |

Henceforth, we present our solution, CycleRoute, which both suggests and summarizes optimized cycling routes based on user preferences, taking the guesswork and effort out of cycle route planning!
